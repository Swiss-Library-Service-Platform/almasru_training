## 🚀 Introduction

In this workshop, we explore **SRU APIs** to access data from the **Swisscovery** and **Renouvaud** catalogs, focusing on **open data** and the tools that provide access.  
We will use the Python library **almasru** to:  

- Determine which libraries hold a specific title  
- Check if a record is linked to other records with copies (potentially removable)  
- Detect duplicates for a given record
